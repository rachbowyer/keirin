Keirin v Criterium
------------------

1) Detects compilation, classloading, GC in a trial and discards it
2) Uses median not mean - which is more robust against outliers
3) Runs faster than Criterium out of the box - 30 x 300ms v 60 x 1 sec - and seems to give good results.
4) Uses less memory than Criterium - holds hash values rather than results
5) Less likely to GC than Criterium as shorter running time - 300ms v 1 second - and less memory
