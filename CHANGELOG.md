# Change Log

## [1.1.2] - 2021-04-15

### Changed
- Adjust timing loop so it is run twice. Times from the first run are disregarded. 
  The idea is to use the first run to trigger any runtime optimisations prior to 
  the second timed run.


## [1.1.1] - 2021-03-10

### Changed
- Now runs on Java 11.
